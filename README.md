# 👋🏽 Hi, I'm Anup Raj Gudisse

I build thoughtful, data-informed software experiences that balance usability, reliability, and measurable impact. From reimagining legacy systems at the Chicago Transit Authority to crafting responsive web presences for UIC's marketing teams, I enjoy turning complex requirements into elegant, production-ready products.

## 🔎 Snapshot
- 📍 Based in Chicago, IL — open to full-time software engineering roles starting May 2025
- 🎓 M.S. Computer Science @ University of Illinois Chicago (Data Science, AI/ML, Advanced CV)
- 🛠️ Strengths across full-stack web, data engineering, and applied machine learning
- 🤝 Collaborative by default: I thrive in cross-functional teams and ship iteratively with feedback

## 🚀 What I'm Delivering
- **Learning Management System modernization (CTA)**: Designed and launched a Django-powered LMS with secure RBAC, REST APIs, and AWS Redshift storage — eliminating 90%+ of manual recordkeeping while unlocking real-time Power BI insights for 20+ stakeholders.
- **Data migration & analytics pipelines**: Engineered Python/Pandas ETL flows that transformed 30 years of bus mechanic training data, boosting validation accuracy by 95% and cutting processing time by 70%.
- **Searchable training intelligence**: Replaced brittle free-text inputs with curated data models and dropdowns, improving lookup efficiency by 50% for instructors and managers.
- **WCAG-conscious digital experiences (UIC Creative & Digital Services)**: Maintain SEO-optimized WordPress sites with 99.9% uptime, partnering with design, video, and photo teams to ship accessible UI enhancements 35% faster.
